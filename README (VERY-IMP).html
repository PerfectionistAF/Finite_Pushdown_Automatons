    <h1 id="title">My Automaton App User Guide</h1>
	<h2> To run the project, you can run it from the Exectuable file found in the Exectuable file directory/Automata.exe.</h2>
    <p>This is a quick user guide on how to get started with My Automaton App</p>
    <p>This is the first panel you will see when you run the program</p>
    <img src="" alt="first-screen">
    <p>You can either click on "Convert NFA to DFA" or "Convert CFG to PDA" depending on your choice</p>
    <p>Now let's discuss how to use both UI's in order to perform the required conversion</p>

    <ol>
        <li><h2>NFA to DFA</h2>
            <img src="img/first-screen.png" alt="nfa-to-dfa">
            <p>To input the NFA that is going be converted to DFA, you have to follow the following steps: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Insert all of the required fields (States,Input Symbols,Start, and Accepting States) as shown in the following example</li>
                <img src="img/example-1.png" alt="example-1">
                <li>Click on "Add transition table" to add edges between states you want to connect</li>
                <img src="img/add-transition-table-screen.png" alt="add transition table screen">
                <li>Add in the "From" field the source state as shown above</li>
                <li>Add in the "To" field the destination state as shown above</li> 
                <li>Add in the "On" field the symbol that transfers from the source to the destination state as shown above</li> 
                <li>Then ckick on the "Add edge" button</li>
                <li>Keep repeating the previous 3 steps until you have added all the edges of your NFA</li>
                <li>Whenyou are done, Click on the "Done" button</li> 
                <li>Then click on "Draw DFA" to display the required DFA output</li>
                <img src="img/DFA Output.png" alt="DFA output">
               
            </ul>
        </li>
        <p>Your are now done! now click on the "Back" button to see how to convert CFG to PDA and click on the "Convert CFG to PDA" button</p>
        <li><h2>CFG to PDA</h2>
            <img src="img/cfg-to-pda.png" alt="cfg-to-pda">
        <ul>
            <li>Now we are going to repeat the exact same steps as before to convert the CFG to PDA</li>
            <img src="img/example-2.png" alt="example-2">
            <li>Insert all required fields as shown above</li>
            <li>Click on "Add Production Rules"</li>
            <img src="img/add-production-rule.png" alt="add production rule">
            <li>In the same as "Add transition table" add the all the required productions and click on "add edge" each time you want to add a production rule </li>
            <li>When you're done, Click on the "Done" button</li>
            <li>Then click on "draw pda" to display the generated PDA as shown below</li>
            <img src="img/pda output.png" alt="pda output">


        </ul></li>
    </ol>
